# Fitness
Windows Forms application that simulates the spreading of a certain trait in a organism population. This was made for the thesis of a biologist friend of mine.

The trait A determines the biological fitness â€“ that is, chance of reproduction - of the organisms. The application simulates the evolution of the population over a certain number of generations. For each generation, it prints the proportion of individuals with the A trait. 

The results of each replica of the simulation are printed on a csv file that can be easily imported in Excel.
